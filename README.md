Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app that I developed was a weight tracking application. The user wanted a few specific goals to be reached from this application. The goals included a database with three tables which tracked stored daily weight, user login and password information, and the last part of the data base was to store a goal weight. This meant the application needed a login screen or a new suer account creation screen. It also needed a main screen which took the users weight inputs and then outputted the stored information. Lastly a screen or setting that allowed SMS notification permissions. For the pages to meet the goals each page needed specific mechanism to trigger when different user actions were done.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed to accomplish this goal, and which were created for this application were a user logins screen which took inputs for username and password, and then had buttons that allowed the user to login or go to the next page which was the cerate account page. In the create account page there were three inputs which included username, passsword1, and password 2 to verify their password, lastly the page had two buttons a login button and a back to login screen button. These pages were created to also let the user know if their account existed or not or if their information was incorrect. The next page was a home screen page which had three inputs which were name, date, and weight. Then it had a button at the bottom to go to the settings page. The user would input their information and it would store it in the database and then the user could look at the information in a list over a period of time. Lastly the settings page had a slider bar that when turned on would give the app SMS notification permissions. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My approach when working with the application changed over time and I ultimately chose the best approach was to first create a rough draft of what I wanted the application to look like by going off of the user’s goals. Once this was completed, I created all necessary pages to start with. I then went page to page and added all the necessary visual information including input areas, text, and buttons. I then created a function to have buttons take the user from one page to another page. After that I worked on the database for all the stored information I needed, which then I needed to connect to the specific pages it pertained to. Once this was completed, I added images and logos to the pages and ran tests to make sure the app functioned properly. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

To test my code and its functionality I mostly did hands on testing which I would run through page to page and ensure that it functioned properly. When an issue comes up or the app crashes, I would look at the log and see what the issue was and then make corrections. This process is crucial to ensure the program runs smoothly and won’t cause issues to the user while also ensuring that all the goals are met. When an issue would come up it would reveal that a function of the application wasn’t working properly and thus, I would need to fix it for it to become useable and prevent security issues. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When going through the development of the application the area that I had to innovate and overcome a challenge had to do with the SQLlite database and getting the tables to store information correctly. During this process I had a lot of issues with the pages not finding the right table to store the information on. I had to look at example and go through my code to get a better understanding of what was happening and why. These issues came up during the testing phase and I was able to get a better understanding of what was happening when I opened the log information where it showed my there were issues with located the tables for storing and pulling information.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The components of the mobile app that were successful included the setup of the pages, the movement between the pages, toast messages that would happen with different inputs, and the visual design of the application. I was able to set all these examples up well and they worked as designed with the different user inputs. Theses shows my skills well due to how they worked properly but at the same time created an application that was both visually appealing and met all of the user’s goals.
